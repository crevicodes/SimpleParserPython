Angelo wrote all the code from scratch, file input and output, both lexical and syntax analysis, error detection and handling, and comments.
Raaed helped with the file input and output, then tokenizing for the lexer and applying the grammar rules to the parser.
Rhea helped with error detection and handling. Created many test cases to try and optimize error detection and handling. Helped with syntax analysis.
Ezekiel helped with optimizing the lexical and syntax analysis methods, and handling errors. He also did an analysis of the guidelines to make sure we covered everything.
